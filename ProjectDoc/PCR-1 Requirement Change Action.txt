PCR-1: New Requirement - docs to Change:
I propose we call this change request PCR-1 (product change request 1) and use it to document our changes throughout the documentation as follows

SRS
	 - Scope
	 - 2.1 diagram
	 - 4.5.3 REQ-16
ProjectPlan.docx
	 - diagram at least
Traceability Matrix
	 - REQ-16
Problem Description
	 - Diagram

1. I recommend changing the diagram once and pasting it in these docs.
2. The text will need to be changed manually by the doc owner.
3. The check in comment for all should reference PCR-1

4. We need to examine our training data and
	 - determine good batch of data
	 - determine whether we want to attempt the option formula
		 - the program will help us do this with our testing.
